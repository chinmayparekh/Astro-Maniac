Astro-Maniac is a single-player endless-running space game. In which, the player controls the Spaceship at the bottom of the screen, which can move horizontally. Various obstacles (Alien, UFO, Asteroids, and Meteoroids) will be approaching the Spaceship. If any of the objects touch the Spaceship the player loses the game. Also, the player has to collect fuel tanks which will be spawning along with the obstacles to keep the game going. On missing three consecutive fuels the game comes to an end. In order to dodge the obstacles, the player has to move the spaceship left or right by pressing D and A from the keyboard respectively. This game becomes challenging as our mind has developed muscle memory of D as Right move and  A as left move.
